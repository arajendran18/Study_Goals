Environment : Non-Prod
Urgency : High
Business Impact, if not addressed : Delays in autoscaling could affect processing of critical transactional data, leading to customer experience issues.

Description : We facing issues with Vault authentication and KEDA Kafka scaler integration in the following microservices:
 omni-purch-digital-txn-updates-streamer
 omni-purchase-digital-ord-updates-consumer
 oms-narvar-orderapi
 oms-transactional-email

Issue 1: Vault Authentication Failure
Affected Namespace:
digital-myaccount-txn-updates-streamer-dev

Error Observed:
403 Permission Denied during Vault login via Kubernetes service account.

Relevant Log:

time=2025-04-10T08:26:07.631Z level=ERROR msg="failed to request new Vault token" app=vault-secrets-webhook

Vault Configuration in use:
username: {{ printf "vault:app-kafka2-kv/data/eth/read/npd/%s/main-key#api_key" (lower .Values.kafkaVault.svcAccountName) | b64enc | quote }}
password: {{ printf "vault:app-kafka2-kv/data/eth/read/npd/%s/main-key#api_secret" (lower .Values.kafkaVault.svcAccountName) | b64enc | quote }}
This configuration is working successfully in other microservices (e.g., OTEOC, COC, NOA - SBX), which indicates a potential issue with:

RoleBinding/ClusterRoleBinding for the service account

Vault policy permissions

Vault role configuration

‚öôÔ∏è Issue 2: KEDA Kafka Scaler Malfunction
In the same set of microservices, I am seeing the following recurring issues with KEDA Kafka scaler:

Secrets are not being pulled properly

ScaledObject resources show a "ScaledObject check failed" status

KEDA HPA is not taking over ownership from the standard HPA as expected

All affected microservices are using the same configuration that works in other environments, which suggests the issue might be environment-specific or related to service-specific Vault/KEDA setup.



üÜò Request:
Requesting the PRE team's help to:

Review Vault role, policy, and binding configurations for the affected namespaces/service accounts

Investigate KEDA scaler behavior for these services in the affected environment

Cross-check environment-specific differences vs. the working ones (OTEOC, COC, NOA - SBX)

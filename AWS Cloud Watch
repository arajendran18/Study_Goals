Cloud watch is a service/gatekeeper/watchman watching the activity happening on AWS cloud. It monitors resources and applications.

Example: Creating EC2 instances, uploading some content in S3 bucket, creating any resources in AWS.

Basically it implements the below:
	• Monitoring 
	• Alerting
	• Reporting
	• Logging

	1. Monitoring: Biggest advantage in AWS. Cloud watch plays critical role in infrastructure monitoring
	2. Real life metrics: Metrics - Easy way to communicate
		a. When you are using EC2 instances, how many API request did my application inside the EC2 instance receive?
		b. During the last 30 mins, what was the CPU utilization on my AWS EC2 instance  or what was the memory consumption
	3. Alarms: To take action on the taken metrics outcome
		a. If the CPU utilization becomes more than 80%, send out an alarm to this email address
		b. If the CPU utilization reaches than 60%, notify me warning message
	4. Log insights: It can provide an log - this user/service tried to access your EC2 instance and particular S3 bucket
	5. Custom metrics: Cloud watch does not monitor the memory utilization. Someone has to configure for the required metrics.
	6. Cost Optimization: Lambda functions
	7. Scaling: Cloud watch is not directly perform scaling. But it can integrated with other services (lambda) to perform desired activity.

Log group: Today you created a project in code build, all the activities that are happening in the project, cloud watch automatically creates a log group and it will log all the information inside the log group only.

Alarms can be configured with SNS topic or any mail alerts or any other application such as pagerduty

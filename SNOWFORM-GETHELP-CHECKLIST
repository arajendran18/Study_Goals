### **Checklist for Testing the ServiceNow Catalog Form**

Below is a comprehensive checklist to help you test all aspects of the implemented ServiceNow form. This ensures the form functions as expected and meets your requirements.

---

### **1. Basic Accessibility**
- [ ] Verify the form loads correctly in the test environment using the provided URL.
- [ ] Confirm all fields are visible and accessible to the user.

---

### **2. Field-Level Functionality**
#### **Environment Field**
- [ ] Verify the "Environment" field exists with the dropdown options "Prod" and "Non-Prod".
- [ ] Ensure selecting "Prod" displays the appropriate severity levels: **Critical, High, Medium**.
- [ ] Ensure selecting "Non-Prod" displays the appropriate severity levels: **High, Medium**.

#### **Severity Field**
- [ ] Verify the severity dropdown dynamically updates based on the "Environment" selection.
- [ ] Test if invalid combinations (e.g., selecting "Critical" for "Non-Prod") are restricted.

#### **Urgency Field**
- [ ] Check if the "Urgency" field replaces the "Business Priority" field.
- [ ] Ensure the urgency options **Critical, High, Medium** are available.
- [ ] Confirm the definitions (e.g., Critical, High, Medium) are clear in the popup when a selection is made.
    - Example:
      - Critical: *Critical system experiencing major outage with a major business impact.*
      - High: *Major issue impacting a small group of users where a workaround is in place.*
      - Medium: *Minor issue with a workaround in place.*

#### **Business Impact Field**
- [ ] Verify the "Business Impact, if not addressed" field exists and is mandatory.

#### **Additional Info Field**
- [ ] Confirm the "Additional Info (URL/Screenshot/Log Information)" field is present and optional.
- [ ] Validate that multiple types of inputs (URLs, text, attachments) can be added.

#### **Authentication Methods Field**
- [ ] Check if the "Authentication Methods" dropdown is present.
- [ ] Verify that "Vault UI access issue" is included as an option in the dropdown.

---

### **3. Incident Creation**
- [ ] Submit a test incident using the form.
- [ ] Verify that after submission:
  - All selected fields (e.g., Auth Method, Environment) are correctly saved.
  - None of the selected fields display as "undefined" in the description box.
- [ ] Test with different combinations of Environment, Urgency, and Authentication Method to ensure the incident submission works as expected.
- [ ] Check that the reference link for Azure AD group creation is included in the summary of the incident:
  - Example Link: `https://luluprod.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=41f9add947601d10593284b8536d4301`.

---

### **4. Auto-Mapping Functionality**
#### **Impacted Services and Affected CI**
- [ ] Verify that "Impacted Services" and "Affected CI" fields are auto-filled based on the selected Environment and Authentication Method.
- [ ] Confirm these fields become mandatory only when the incident status is changed to **"In Progress"**.
- [ ] Test various combinations to validate the correct mapping.

---

### **5. Error Handling**
- [ ] Submit the form with incomplete or invalid data to ensure appropriate error messages are displayed.
- [ ] Verify that mandatory fields prevent submission if left empty.

---

### **6. Usability**
- [ ] Ensure that the form layout is user-friendly and fields are intuitively organized.
- [ ] Confirm field descriptions and hints are clear and easy to understand.

---

### **7. Notifications and Logs**
- [ ] Check if any notifications or alerts are triggered upon form submission.
- [ ] Verify that submission details are logged accurately in ServiceNow.

---

### **8. Integration Check**
- [ ] Test if the incident triggers any follow-up workflows or tasks as expected.
- [ ] Verify that the form integrates seamlessly with other modules or systems (e.g., Incident Management).

---

### **9. Cross-Browser Compatibility**
- [ ] Test the form in multiple browsers (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Firefox) to ensure consistent performance.

---

### **10. Final Validation**
- [ ] Verify that all implemented requirements from the initial list are met.
- [ ] Provide feedback on missing features or areas needing improvement.

---

### **Testing Notes**
- Document any issues you encounter during the testing process, including:
  - Steps to reproduce the issue.
  - Expected behavior versus actual behavior.
- Communicate these findings to the ServiceNow engineer for resolution.

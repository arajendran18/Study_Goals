### **Team-Level Issues: All Team Members Unable to Access Vault**

Here are possible scenarios and their detailed descriptions:

---

#### **1. Missing Team-Wide Azure AD Group Membership**
- **Description:**  
  The entire team is not part of the required Azure AD group that grants access to Vault. This could occur due to a configuration oversight when setting up the team or when onboarding new projects.
- **Troubleshooting:**  
  - Verify if the Azure AD group exists for the team.
  - Check if the team members have been added to the correct group.
  - Ensure the group is assigned the necessary Vault policies.

---

#### **2. Vault Policy Misconfiguration**
- **Description:**  
  The policy assigned to the team's Azure AD group does not include the required permissions for accessing Vault paths or resources.
- **Troubleshooting:**  
  - Validate the policy associated with the Azure AD group.
  - Check if the policy has the correct paths and capabilities (e.g., `read`, `list`, `update`).
  - If issues are found, work with the Vault administrator to adjust the policy.

---

#### **3. Vault Path Configuration Issue**
- **Description:**  
  The team’s designated Vault paths are misconfigured or have been deleted. This could lead to access errors for all members attempting to retrieve secrets or credentials.
- **Troubleshooting:**  
  - Confirm the existence of the paths associated with the team.
  - Validate the policies referencing these paths.
  - Restore or reconfigure missing or misaligned paths.

---

#### **4. Incorrect Azure AD Role Mapping in Vault**
- **Description:**  
  The Azure AD group is mapped to the wrong Vault role or no role at all, preventing the entire team from authenticating successfully.
- **Troubleshooting:**  
  - Check the Azure AD role mappings in Vault.
  - Ensure that the group is correctly associated with the intended Vault role.
  - Update the role mapping to include the correct Azure AD group if required.

---

#### **5. Vault Authentication Backend Outage or Misconfiguration**
- **Description:**  
  The Azure AD authentication method in Vault is experiencing an outage or has been disabled. This prevents all users authenticating through Azure AD from accessing Vault.
- **Troubleshooting:**  
  - Verify the status of the Azure AD authentication method in Vault.
  - Check Vault logs for errors related to Azure AD integration.
  - Re-enable or fix the Azure AD backend configuration.

---

#### **6. Network or Connectivity Issues**
- **Description:**  
  The network connection between the application team’s environment and Vault is disrupted, making Vault inaccessible to all team members.
- **Troubleshooting:**  
  - Test connectivity to the Vault server (e.g., via `ping` or `curl` commands).
  - Check for firewall rules or network policies that might block access.
  - Coordinate with the networking team to resolve connectivity issues.

---

#### **7. Vault Server Outage or High Load**
- **Description:**  
  The Vault server is experiencing downtime, resource exhaustion, or is under high load, leading to unavailability for all users.
- **Troubleshooting:**  
  - Check the status of the Vault server and nodes.
  - Investigate logs for signs of resource limits or errors.
  - Restart services or scale the infrastructure if required.

---

#### **8. Expired or Revoked Azure AD Token for the Team**
- **Description:**  
  The team’s Azure AD token used for authentication has expired or has been revoked, preventing all members from logging into Vault.
- **Troubleshooting:**  
  - Validate the team’s Azure AD token validity.
  - Renew or reconfigure the token as necessary.
  - Ensure that the token expiration aligns with the team’s usage patterns.

---

#### **9. Onboarding Delays for a New Team**
- **Description:**  
  A newly onboarded team has not been fully set up in Vault or Azure AD, resulting in access issues for all members.
- **Troubleshooting:**  
  - Verify if the team's Azure AD group and Vault roles have been created.
  - Check if necessary policies and paths have been assigned.
  - Expedite the onboarding process to resolve delays.

---

#### **10. Team-Specific Access Suspension**
- **Description:**  
  Access for the team has been temporarily revoked due to compliance or security concerns, such as audits or suspicious activity.
- **Troubleshooting:**  
  - Confirm with the compliance or security team if access was suspended.
  - Address the underlying concerns causing the suspension.
  - Request reactivation of access once issues are resolved.

These scenarios can be included in a runbook with detailed steps for troubleshooting and resolution, ensuring the team can address issues independently or escalate with adequate context.

Here is a **detailed explanation of the purpose** for each query, including what each metric indicates, potential causes, and the impact on the Vault system:

---

### **1. Core Leader Lost Detection**  
```plaintext
| mstats sum(vault.core.leadership_lost.count) as count where `vault_telemetry` AND cluster=* span=1m
| timechart bins=1000 sum(count) AS count
| where count>=2
```
**Purpose:**  
- This query tracks **how often a Vault leader node loses leadership**.  
- **Impact:** Leadership loss triggers re-election in a Vault cluster, and during this process, operations (such as reads and writes) might temporarily fail or become slow.  
- **Possible Causes:**
  - Network disruptions or high latency between nodes.
  - Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory) on the leader node.
  - Unstable Raft consensus algorithm due to misconfiguration or node failures.
  
This query ensures quick detection of cluster instability to prevent degraded service or unexpected behavior.

---

### **2. DELETE Request Latency Monitoring**  
```plaintext
| mstats latest(vault.raft-storage.delete.mean) as latency where `vault_telemetry` AND cluster="prd-vault" span=1m
| timechart bins=1000 mean(latency) as latency
| eventstats perc90(latency) perc50(latency)
| where latency>15
```
**Purpose:**  
- Monitors **the time taken for DELETE requests** on the Raft storage backend.  
- **Impact:** Slow DELETE operations can cause delays when applications or users try to remove secrets, tokens, or leases, leading to failures in cleanup processes.
- **Possible Causes:**  
  - Disk I/O issues on storage nodes.
  - Network latency between Vault nodes.
  - Raft storage experiencing contention or performance degradation.

This query helps identify if there is any slowness when removing stale data, preventing storage bloat and operational delays.

---

### **3. GET Request Latency Monitoring**  
```plaintext
| mstats latest(vault.raft-storage.get.mean) as latency where `vault_telemetry` AND cluster="prd-vault" span=1m
| timechart bins=1000 mean(latency) as latency
| eventstats perc90(latency) perc50(latency)
| where latency>0.3
```
**Purpose:**  
- Monitors **latency in GET (read) requests** from the Raft storage backend.  
- **Impact:** High latency in GET requests means secrets retrieval becomes slower, causing delays in applications that depend on Vault to access secrets (e.g., API tokens or credentials).  
- **Possible Causes:**
  - Heavy load on the storage backend.
  - Insufficient resources on Vault nodes (e.g., CPU, memory).
  - Network issues impacting communication between nodes.

This query ensures Vault remains performant and responsive for secret lookups.

---

### **4. LIST Request Latency Monitoring**  
```plaintext
| mstats latest(vault.raft-storage.list.mean) as latency where `vault_telemetry` AND cluster=* span=1m
| timechart bins=1000 mean(latency) as latency
| eventstats perc90(latency) perc50(latency)
| where latency>1.5
```
**Purpose:**  
- Tracks **latency for LIST operations**, which are used to enumerate secrets or mounts.  
- **Impact:** If LIST requests are slow, it could affect workflows where Vault needs to query multiple paths, such as secret rotation or configuration management.  
- **Possible Causes:**
  - Large number of secrets or mounts stored in Vault.
  - Insufficient backend capacity or storage bottlenecks.
  - Excessive concurrent requests to the Vault service.

This query ensures efficient listing of secrets and policies, improving the overall system’s usability.

| timechart bins=1000 mean(latency) as latency
| eventstats perc90(latency) perc50(latency)
| where latency>80
```
**Purpose:**  
- Monitors **latency for handling user login requests** to Vault.  
- **Impact:** If login operations are slow, users might experience delays accessing Vault secrets, impacting critical services.  
- **Possible Causes:**
  - Authentication backend (e.g., LDAP or AD) experiencing slowness.
  - High load on the Vault server.
  - Network latency or misconfigured authentication policies.

This query helps ensure authentication remains fast and users can log in promptly.

---

### **6. Node Memory Usage Monitoring**  
```plaintext
| mstats max(mem.used_percent) AS used WHERE `vault_telemetry` AND cluster=* AND (host=*) BY host span=1m
| stats max(used) AS used BY host
| eval Critical_Usage = if(used > 70, "Yes", "No")
| where Critical_Usage="Yes"
```
**Purpose:**  
- Monitors **memory usage on individual Vault nodes** to detect if usage exceeds 70%.  
- **Impact:** If a node consumes too much memory, it may crash or become unresponsive, disrupting the cluster.  
- **Possible Causes:**
  - Memory leaks in Vault processes.
  - High number of concurrent requests.
  - Insufficient memory allocation on the node.

This query ensures timely action if nodes are running out of memory, preventing unexpected failures.

| timechart bins=1000 mean(latency) as latency
| eventstats perc90(latency) perc50(latency)
| where latency>10
```
**Purpose:**  
- Monitors **latency of PUT operations**, which are used to store secrets or update policies in the Raft storage backend.  
- **Impact:** High latency in PUT requests affects how quickly new secrets are written or policies are updated, which can delay deployments or configuration changes.  
- **Possible Causes:**
  - Disk I/O bottlenecks.
  - Network issues between Vault nodes.
  - Large payload sizes causing slow processing.

This query ensures fast write operations to maintain operational efficiency.

---

### **8. Overall Request Latency Monitoring**  
```plaintext
| mstats mean(vault.core.handle_request.mean) as latency where `vault_telemetry` AND cluster=prd*vault span=1m

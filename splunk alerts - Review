Here is a **detailed explanation of the purpose** for each query, including what each metric indicates, potential causes, and the impact on the Vault system:

---

### **1. Core Leader Lost Detection**  
```plaintext
| mstats sum(vault.core.leadership_lost.count) as count where `vault_telemetry` AND cluster=* span=1m
| timechart bins=1000 sum(count) AS count
| where count>=2
```
**Purpose:**  
- This query tracks **how often a Vault leader node loses leadership**.  
- **Impact:** Leadership loss triggers re-election in a Vault cluster, and during this process, operations (such as reads and writes) might temporarily fail or become slow.  
- **Possible Causes:**
  - Network disruptions or high latency between nodes.
  - Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory) on the leader node.
  - Unstable Raft consensus algorithm due to misconfiguration or node failures.
  
This query ensures quick detection of cluster instability to prevent degraded service or unexpected behavior.

---

### **2. DELETE Request Latency Monitoring**  
```plaintext
| mstats latest(vault.raft-storage.delete.mean) as latency where `vault_telemetry` AND cluster="prd-vault" span=1m
| timechart bins=1000 mean(latency) as latency
| eventstats perc90(latency) perc50(latency)
| where latency>15
```
**Purpose:**  
- Monitors **the time taken for DELETE requests** on the Raft storage backend.  
- **Impact:** Slow DELETE operations can cause delays when applications or users try to remove secrets, tokens, or leases, leading to failures in cleanup processes.
- **Possible Causes:**  
  - Disk I/O issues on storage nodes.
  - Network latency between Vault nodes.
  - Raft storage experiencing contention or performance degradation.

This query helps identify if there is any slowness when removing stale data, preventing storage bloat and operational delays.

---

### **3. GET Request Latency Monitoring**  
```plaintext

To notify only if the **"External" stage (5th stage)** fails in your GitLab pipeline, you can set up a webhook that triggers notifications for specific conditions or configure a custom script in GitLab CI to send notifications only if that stage fails.

Here’s how to approach this:

### Step 1: Set Up the Pipeline Stages in GitLab

1. Define the five stages in your GitLab CI pipeline (`.gitlab-ci.yml`):

   ```yaml
   stages:
     - pre
     - terraform_format
     - lint
     - post
     - external
   ```

2. For each job, assign it to the corresponding stage. The `External` stage will only run if previous stages succeed.

### Step 2: Add a Notification Step Only if the "External" Stage Fails

Use a combination of GitLab CI’s `allow_failure` and conditional notification steps to trigger notifications only for the `External` stage failure.

1. Define a job in the **"External"** stage and use a script or webhook to send a notification only if it fails.

   ```yaml
   external:
     stage: external
     script:
       - # Your commands for the external stage
     allow_failure: false # Ensures failure is reported if this job fails

   notify_failure:
     stage: external
     script:
       - |
         if [ "$CI_JOB_STATUS" == "failed" ]; then
           curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
           --data '{"text":"Pipeline failed at External stage!"}' \
           YOUR_TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL
         fi
     when: on_failure
     dependencies:
       - external # Runs only if the "external" stage fails
     allow_failure: true # Ensures this doesn't affect the pipeline status further
   ```

### Explanation of the Key Configurations

- **`allow_failure: false`** for `external`: Ensures that if the `External` stage fails, it stops the pipeline and marks it as failed.
- **`notify_failure` job**: Runs only if the `external` job fails (`when: on_failure`). It checks if the `CI_JOB_STATUS` is `failed` and sends a notification.
- **Teams Webhook URL**: Replace `YOUR_TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL` with your actual Microsoft Teams webhook URL.

With this setup, you will only receive a notification in Microsoft Teams if the `External` stage fails.

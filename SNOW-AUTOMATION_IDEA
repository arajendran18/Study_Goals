To implement a **separate workflow for each issue type** with a clear process for resolving **User-Specific Issues**, **Team-Level Issues**, and **Path-Specific Issues**, here's how you can design the automation using ServiceNow and integrate it with Vault and Active Directory (AD).

---

### **1. High-Level Design**
- **ServiceNow Catalog Item**: "Vault Access Issue Resolution"
- **Workflow Selection**: Based on user-selected issue type:
  - **User-Specific Issues**
  - **Team-Level Issues**
  - **Path-Specific Issues**

---

### **2. Workflow for User-Specific Issues**
#### **User Inputs**
- Affected username
- Successful username
- Absolute secret path (e.g., `aws/creds/dev-role`)

#### **Workflow Steps**
1. **Validate Input**:
   - Ensure affected username, successful username, and secret path are provided.

2. **Fetch AD Groups**:
   - Use ServiceNow Orchestration to query AD for group memberships:
     - Fetch groups for both the affected and successful users.
     - Identify missing groups for the affected user.

3. **Fetch Vault Policies**:
   - Use the Vault API to retrieve policies associated with the successful user’s groups.
   - Identify the policy that grants access to the secret path.

4. **Determine Responsible Group**:
   - Cross-reference AD groups with Vault policies.
   - Identify the AD group responsible for granting access.

5. **Notification**:
   - Notify the requester with the missing AD group and policy details:
     - **AD Group Name**
     - **Vault Policy** that needs to be assigned.

#### **Example Notification**
- **Subject**: Missing Group for Vault Access
- **Body**:  
  - The affected user (`username`) is missing membership in the AD group **`vault-dev-access`**, which has the required Vault policy **`read-aws-creds`** to access the path `aws/creds/dev-role`.

---

### **3. Workflow for Team-Level Issues**
#### **User Inputs**
- Team or role name (e.g., `vault-dev-team`)
- Absolute secret path (e.g., `aws/creds/dev-role`)

#### **Workflow Steps**
1. **Validate Input**:
   - Ensure the team/role name and secret path are provided.

2. **Fetch AD Group Membership**:
   - Query AD for the group associated with the team.
   - Retrieve users in the group.

3. **Check Vault Policies**:
   - Retrieve the policies associated with the team's AD group.
   - Verify if the policies include the required permissions (`read`, `list`) for the path.

4. **Secret Path Check**:
   - Verify if the secret path exists in Vault and is active.
   - If not, escalate to the Vault admin team to investigate path issues.

5. **Notification**:
   - Notify the requester with:
     - **Missing Policy Details** for the team's group.
     - **Steps for Remediation** (e.g., assigning correct policies).

#### **Example Notification**
- **Subject**: Team-Level Access Issue Resolved  
- **Body**:  
  - The group **`vault-dev-team`** is missing the Vault policy **`read-aws-creds`**, which is required to access the path `aws/creds/dev-role`. Please update the policy or escalate for further assistance.

---

### **4. Workflow for Path-Specific Issues**
#### **User Inputs**
- Absolute secret path (e.g., `aws/creds/dev-role`)
- Optional: Username or team name.

#### **Workflow Steps**
1. **Validate Input**:
   - Ensure the secret path is provided.

2. **Check Path Configuration**:
   - Query Vault to verify the existence and configuration of the secret path:
     - Is the secret engine active?
     - Does the path have policies assigned?

3. **Fetch Path Policies**:
   - Retrieve all policies associated with the path.
   - Identify which AD groups or roles are allowed to access it.

4. **Team/User Permissions**:
   - If a user/team is provided:
     - Cross-reference their AD group memberships with the path’s policies.
     - Identify any missing policies.

5. **Notification**:
   - Notify the requester with:
     - **Path Configuration Issues**
     - **Missing Policies**

#### **Example Notification**
- **Subject**: Path-Specific Access Issue Resolved  
- **Body**:  
  - The secret path `aws/creds/dev-role` exists but is missing the required Vault policy **`read-aws-creds`**. The group **`vault-dev-access`** has the necessary permissions. Assign the user/team to this group for access.

---

### **5. Automation Details**
#### **ServiceNow Integration with AD**
- Use a MID server to query AD groups via LDAP:
  - Fetch the group memberships of users.
  - Compare memberships to identify missing groups.

#### **ServiceNow Integration with Vault**
- Use Vault API to:
  - Retrieve policies assigned to a path.
  - Fetch details of a secret engine’s status.
  - Validate if users or teams have access to specific paths.

#### **Dynamic Form Configuration**
- Use dynamic fields to adjust inputs based on the selected issue type:
  - **User-Specific**: Affected and successful usernames.
  - **Team-Level**: Team/role name.
  - **Path-Specific**: Secret path.

#### **Policy Analysis**
- Automate the process of cross-referencing policies with AD groups and paths to identify gaps.

---

### **6. Benefits of This Workflow**
- **Structured Inputs**: Collects the exact data needed to diagnose issues.
- **Automated Diagnostics**: Reduces manual effort in identifying and resolving issues.
- **Actionable Notifications**: Provides clear next steps to resolve access issues.
- **Scalable Design**: Each workflow targets a specific problem type, allowing modular maintenance.

### **4. Workflow for Environment-Specific Issues**

#### **User Inputs**
- Username or team name.
- Environment (e.g., Non-Production, Production).
- Absolute secret path (e.g., `aws/creds/dev-role`).

---

#### **Workflow Steps**

1. **Validate Input**:
   - Ensure username/team name, environment, and secret path are provided.

2. **Check Path in Affected Environment**:
   - Use the Vault API to query the secret path in the specified environment.
   - Validate the existence and status of the secret engine in the affected environment.

3. **Compare Environments**:
   - Query the secret path in the alternate environment (e.g., Production if the issue is in Non-Production).
   - Compare policies, secret engine configuration, and token issuance settings.

4. **Identify Configuration Differences**:
   - Secret engine disabled or misconfigured in the affected environment.
   - Path-specific policies missing or different between environments.
   - Access control differences in Vault.

5. **Node Health Check**:
   - Validate the health of Vault nodes in the affected environment using the `/sys/health` API.
   - Check for issues like desynchronization or a down node.

6. **Notification**:
   - Provide a summary of discrepancies between environments.
   - Include steps for remediation:
     - Sync configuration.
     - Re-enable secret engines or update policies.

---

#### **Example Notification**
- **Subject**: Environment-Specific Access Issue Resolved  
- **Body**:  
  - Access to the path `aws/creds/dev-role` is unavailable in the Non-Production environment due to:  
    - Secret engine status: **Disabled**.  
    - Missing Vault policy: **read-aws-creds-npd**.  
    - Suggested Fix: Re-enable the secret engine and assign the missing policy.

### **5. Workflow for Authentication Issues**

#### **User Inputs**
- Username.
- Authentication method (e.g., LDAP, Azure AD).
- Error description (e.g., unable to log in, token expired).

---

#### **Workflow Steps**

##### **For Login Issues**:

1. **Validate Input**:
   - Ensure username and authentication method are provided.

2. **Verify Authentication Method**:
   - Confirm the user is attempting to log in using the correct method (e.g., Azure AD for enterprise accounts).
   - Validate the method configuration in Vault.

3. **Check Azure AD Status**:
   - Query Azure AD to verify:
     - The user account is active.
     - Credentials are correct (if integrated with ServiceNow Orchestration).

4. **Vault Policy Verification**:
   - Use the Vault API to ensure the user has policies assigned for the required access.

5. **Escalate for AD Issues**:
   - If the user is not active in Azure AD, notify the requester to contact their IT admin for account reactivation.

##### **For Token Renewal/Assignment Issues**:

1. **Validate Input**:
   - Ensure username and error description (e.g., token expired) are provided.

2. **Check Role Configuration**:
   - Use the Vault API to verify the role associated with the user:
     - `token_policies` assigned to the role.
     - TTL and maximum TTL settings.

3. **Verify Token Status**:
   - Query the user’s current token using Vault’s `/auth/token/lookup` endpoint.
   - Identify if the token:
     - Exceeded its maximum TTL.
     - Has renewal disabled in its role configuration.

4. **Token Reissue**:
   - If applicable, reissue a token with an updated TTL or fix role settings.

5. **Notification**:
   - Notify the user of the issue and provide a renewed token or escalation details.

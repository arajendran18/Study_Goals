To implement a **separate workflow for each issue type** with a clear process for resolving **User-Specific Issues**, **Team-Level Issues**, and **Path-Specific Issues**, here's how you can design the automation using ServiceNow and integrate it with Vault and Active Directory (AD).

---

### **1. High-Level Design**
- **ServiceNow Catalog Item**: "Vault Access Issue Resolution"
- **Workflow Selection**: Based on user-selected issue type:
  - **User-Specific Issues**
  - **Team-Level Issues**
  - **Path-Specific Issues**

---

### **2. Workflow for User-Specific Issues**
#### **User Inputs**
- Affected username
- Successful username
- Absolute secret path (e.g., `aws/creds/dev-role`)

#### **Workflow Steps**
1. **Validate Input**:
   - Ensure affected username, successful username, and secret path are provided.

2. **Fetch AD Groups**:
   - Use ServiceNow Orchestration to query AD for group memberships:
     - Fetch groups for both the affected and successful users.
     - Identify missing groups for the affected user.

3. **Fetch Vault Policies**:
   - Use the Vault API to retrieve policies associated with the successful user’s groups.
   - Identify the policy that grants access to the secret path.

4. **Determine Responsible Group**:
   - Cross-reference AD groups with Vault policies.
   - Identify the AD group responsible for granting access.

5. **Notification**:
   - Notify the requester with the missing AD group and policy details:
     - **AD Group Name**
     - **Vault Policy** that needs to be assigned.

#### **Example Notification**
- **Subject**: Missing Group for Vault Access
- **Body**:  
  - The affected user (`username`) is missing membership in the AD group **`vault-dev-access`**, which has the required Vault policy **`read-aws-creds`** to access the path `aws/creds/dev-role`.

---

### **3. Workflow for Team-Level Issues**
#### **User Inputs**
- Team or role name (e.g., `vault-dev-team`)
- Absolute secret path (e.g., `aws/creds/dev-role`)

#### **Workflow Steps**
1. **Validate Input**:
   - Ensure the team/role name and secret path are provided.

2. **Fetch AD Group Membership**:
   - Query AD for the group associated with the team.
   - Retrieve users in the group.

3. **Check Vault Policies**:
   - Retrieve the policies associated with the team's AD group.
   - Verify if the policies include the required permissions (`read`, `list`) for the path.

4. **Secret Path Check**:
   - Verify if the secret path exists in Vault and is active.
   - If not, escalate to the Vault admin team to investigate path issues.

5. **Notification**:
   - Notify the requester with:
     - **Missing Policy Details** for the team's group.
     - **Steps for Remediation** (e.g., assigning correct policies).

#### **Example Notification**
- **Subject**: Team-Level Access Issue Resolved  
- **Body**:  
  - The group **`vault-dev-team`** is missing the Vault policy **`read-aws-creds`**, which is required to access the path `aws/creds/dev-role`. Please update the policy or escalate for further assistance.

### **4. Workflow for Path-Specific Issues**
#### **User Inputs**
- Absolute secret path (e.g., `aws/creds/dev-role`)
- Optional: Username or team name.

#### **Workflow Steps**
1. **Validate Input**:
   - Ensure the secret path is provided.

2. **Check Path Configuration**:
   - Query Vault to verify the existence and configuration of the secret path:
     - Is the secret engine active?
     - Does the path have policies assigned?

3. **Fetch Path Policies**:
   - Retrieve all policies associated with the path.
   - Identify which AD groups or roles are allowed to access it.

4. **Team/User Permissions**:
   - If a user/team is provided:
     - Cross-reference their AD group memberships with the path’s policies.
     - Identify any missing policies.

5. **Notification**:
   - Notify the requester with:
     - **Path Configuration Issues**
     - **Missing Policies**

#### **Example Notification**
- **Subject**: Path-Specific Access Issue Resolved  
- **Body**:  
  - The secret path `aws/creds/dev-role` exists but is missing the required Vault policy **`read-aws-creds`**. The group **`vault-dev-access`** has the necessary permissions. Assign the user/team to this group for access.

---

### **5. Automation Details**
#### **ServiceNow Integration with AD**
- Use a MID server to query AD groups via LDAP:
  - Fetch the group memberships of users.
  - Compare memberships to identify missing groups.

#### **ServiceNow Integration with Vault**
- Use Vault API to:
  - Retrieve policies assigned to a path.
  - Fetch details of a secret engine’s status.
  - Validate if users or teams have access to specific paths.

#### **Dynamic Form Configuration**
- Use dynamic fields to adjust inputs based on the selected issue type:
  - **User-Specific**: Affected and successful usernames.
  - **Team-Level**: Team/role name.
  - **Path-Specific**: Secret path.

#### **Policy Analysis**
- Automate the process of cross-referencing policies with AD groups and paths to identify gaps.

### **6. Benefits of This Workflow**
- **Structured Inputs**: Collects the exact data needed to diagnose issues.
- **Automated Diagnostics**: Reduces manual effort in identifying and resolving issues.
- **Actionable Notifications**: Provides clear next steps to resolve access issues.
- **Scalable Design**: Each workflow targets a specific problem type, allowing modular maintenance.

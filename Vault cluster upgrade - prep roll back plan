### **Prepare Rollback Plan**

A rollback plan is essential to ensure that you can revert to Vault 1.16 in case of any issues during or after the upgrade to Vault 1.18. Having a well-documented and tested rollback procedure minimizes downtime and data loss, ensuring that your Vault instance remains stable, secure, and functional.

Here's how to prepare a rollback plan in case the Vault 1.18 upgrade fails:

---

### **1. Document Steps to Revert to Vault 1.16**

**Purpose**:  
The rollback plan outlines the exact steps to take if Vault 1.18 encounters issues. This plan should detail how to revert to the previous version (1.16) without impacting the availability of Vault or its data.

#### **Action Steps**:
- **Stop Vault 1.18**:  
  - If Vault 1.18 encounters issues, the first step is to safely stop the Vault service to prevent any further disruptions or corruptions.
  
  **Example Command**:
  ```bash
  systemctl stop vault
  ```

- **Reinstall Vault 1.16**:  
  - Once Vault 1.18 is stopped, you can reinstall Vault 1.16. Depending on your operating system and how Vault was installed (e.g., via a package manager or direct binary download), the method to downgrade will vary. For example, using `apt` or `yum` for Linux-based systems:
  
  **Example Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install vault=1.16.x
  ```

  Or, if using the binary installation method, download the Vault 1.16 binary from the official HashiCorp website and replace the existing Vault binary with the older version.

- **Restore Configuration Files**:  
  - If any configuration files were modified during the upgrade, restore the backup of the Vault 1.16 configuration files (`config.hcl` or similar). Ensure that all changes made during the Vault 1.18 upgrade are reverted.
  
  **Example**:
  ```bash
  cp /path/to/backup/config.hcl /etc/vault.d/config.hcl
  ```

- **Restore Vault Data from Backup**:  
  - If the Vault data (e.g., stored secrets or policies) was affected during the upgrade, restore from the backup created before the upgrade.
  
  **Example Command**:
  ```bash
  vault operator raft snapshot restore /path/to/backup/snapshot.snap
  ```

  If using a different storage backend (e.g., Consul, AWS), ensure that the proper data is restored from the respective backup method.

- **Restart Vault 1.16**:  
  - After reinstalling Vault 1.16 and restoring configuration and data, start the Vault service to bring it back online.
  
  **Example Command**:
  ```bash
  systemctl start vault
  ```

- **Verify Vault Status**:  
  - Check that Vault is running correctly on version 1.16, and that all secrets, authentication methods, and policies are functioning as expected.

  **Example Command**:
  ```bash
  vault status
  ```

- **Monitor for Issues**:  
  - After the rollback, monitor Vault for any issues that may arise, especially around replication, availability, and user access. Verify that all clients and applications can interact with Vault properly.

### **2. Ensure Backups are Available and Tested**

**Purpose**:  
Before initiating any upgrade or rollback, it's crucial to ensure that backups are available and tested. These backups should contain both configuration files and Vault data (secrets, policies, and settings). Without tested backups, a rollback could result in data loss or service disruption.

#### **Action Steps**:
- **Backup Configuration Files**:  
  - Always take a backup of your Vault configuration files before upgrading (such as `config.hcl`, any custom plugins, or specific Vault-related settings).

  **Example**:
  ```bash
  cp /etc/vault.d/config.hcl /path/to/backup/config.hcl
  ```

- **Backup Vault Data**:  
  - Take a backup of Vault's data (secrets, policies, etc.) before the upgrade using Vault's snapshot or the storage backend's native backup tools.

  For **Raft storage**:
  ```bash
  vault operator raft snapshot save /path/to/backup/snapshot.snap
  ```

  For **Consul**:
  ```bash
  consul snapshot save /path/to/backup/consul.snap
  ```

  For **AWS**:
  - Ensure that any Vault AWS secrets or configurations are backed up.

- **Test the Backups**:  
  - Ensure that the backups are valid and can be restored. Perform a test restoration to verify that you can roll back to the previous state.
  
  **Test Restoration for Raft Storage**:
  ```bash
  vault operator raft snapshot restore /path/to/backup/snapshot.snap
  ```

  - Confirm that the Vault instance restores all data (secrets, policies, configurations) correctly.

### **3. Test the Rollback Plan**

**Purpose**:  
Before implementing any major upgrade or change, test the rollback plan in a staging environment. This ensures that the plan works as expected and minimizes risks in case of failure.

#### **Action Steps**:
- **Test the Full Rollback Process**:  
  - In your staging environment, simulate an upgrade to Vault 1.18 and then simulate a failure, testing the rollback steps (reinstalling 1.16, restoring backups, and ensuring the system is operational).
  
- **Verify Functionality After Rollback**:  
  - After the rollback is completed, verify that all functionality (secrets engines, authentication methods, policies, and replication) is working correctly.

---

### **4. Communication Plan**

**Purpose**:  
If the rollback is necessary, communication with stakeholders, users, and clients is crucial to ensure that everyone is informed and the service disruption is minimized.

#### **Action Steps**:
- **Notify Stakeholders**:  
  - Inform internal and external stakeholders (application teams, security teams, etc.) about the rollback and any expected downtime.

- **Update Documentation**:  
  - Document the reason for the rollback and any steps taken to resolve the issue. Keep detailed logs to ensure traceability.

---

### **Summary of Rollback Plan**:
1. **Stop Vault 1.18**: Safely stop Vault to prevent further issues.
2. **Reinstall Vault 1.16**: Reinstall the previous version of Vault.
3. **Restore Configuration Files and Data**: Roll back to the backup configuration files and restore Vault data.
4. **Start Vault 1.16**: Restart Vault and verify its operational status.
5. **Monitor Vault**: Ensure Vault functions as expected after the rollback.

**Ensure that backups are created, tested, and stored properly before any upgrade attempt. This provides a solid safety net in case the upgrade to 1.18 fails.**

By following this plan, you minimize the risks associated with upgrading Vault, ensuring that you can restore to a stable version if needed.

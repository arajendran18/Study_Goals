Problem:
Alice finds that root_kms.crt is referenced in Vault’s install script (install_vault.sh.tpl), but the file doesn’t exist in GitLab. The team needs to confirm if it’s actively used.

Task:
✅ Check if /opt/vault/tls/kms_root.crt is used in Vault config
✅ Search GitLab UI for root_kms.crt references
✅ Remove unused code if the cert is not required

Acceptance Criteria:

Root KMS cert is either removed or confirmed as required.
Vault installation script is updated.

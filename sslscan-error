You might want to run 'apt --fix-broken install' to correct these.
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 gcc : Depends: cpp (= 4:9.3.0-1ubuntu2) but it is not going to be installed
       Depends: gcc-9 (>= 9.3.0-3~) but it is not going to be installed
       Recommends: libc6-dev but it is not going to be installed or
                   libc-dev
 sslscan : Depends: libc6 (>= 2.38) but 2.31-0ubuntu9.17 is to be installed
           Depends: libssl3t64 (>= 3.0.0) but it is not installable
E: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt --fix-broken install' with no packages (or specify a solution).

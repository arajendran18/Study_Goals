Upgrading Vault requires careful planning and validation to ensure stability and avoid data loss or service disruption. Below is a detailed checklist and steps to perform before initiating the upgrade.

---

### **1. Pre-Upgrade Preparation**
#### **A. Validate Cluster Stability**
1. **Check Vault Health**:
   - Run the `sys/health` API to check the health of all nodes in the cluster.
   ```bash
   curl -s http://<vault-address>:8200/v1/sys/health
   ```
   - Ensure all nodes report as `sealed=false`, `initialized=true`, and `standby` or `active`.

2. **Monitor Logs**:
   - Review Vault server logs across all nodes for errors or warnings.
   - Look for signs of cluster instability, such as failed Raft communication, replication issues, or unseal failures.

3. **Replication Health (if applicable)**:
   - Use the `sys/replication/performance` and `sys/replication/dr` API to ensure replication is healthy:
     ```bash
     vault read sys/replication/status
     ```
   - Confirm replication lag is minimal.

4. **Raft Storage Health**:
   - Check Raft storage status to ensure all peers are active:
     ```bash
     vault operator raft list-peers
     ```
   - Ensure there is a quorum (majority of nodes must be healthy).

---

#### **B. Backup Critical Data**
1. **Vault Data Backup**:
   - Take a backup of the storage backend (e.g., Raft snapshots, Consul data).
   - For Raft, run:
     ```bash
     vault operator raft snapshot save <snapshot-file>
     ```
   - Store the backup in a secure location.

2. **Configuration Backup**:
   - Backup all Vault configuration files (e.g., `vault.hcl`) from each node.
   - Include certificates and TLS-related files if applicable.

3. **Audit Logs**:
   - Ensure all audit logs are archived for reference post-upgrade.

---

#### **C. Review Existing Configurations**
1. **Check Auto-Unseal Configuration**:
   - Verify that your auto-unseal mechanism (e.g., AWS KMS or HSM) is properly configured and working.
   - Test the unseal process on a standby node.

2. **Review Policies and Auth Methods**:
   - List all active policies and auth methods to confirm their validity:
     ```bash
     vault list sys/policies/acl
     vault list sys/auth
     ```

3. **Inspect Secrets Engines**:
   - Ensure all secrets engines (e.g., KV, AWS, Azure) are configured correctly and operational:
     ```bash
     vault secrets list
     ```

4. **Ensure Cluster Leader is Stable**:
   - Verify which node is the active leader:
     ```bash
     vault status
     ```

---

#### **D. Compatibility Checks**
1. **Review Release Notes**:
   - Read the release notes for versions between 1.16.3 and 1.18.3:
     - Identify deprecated features, breaking changes, and required configuration updates.

2. **Upgrade Path**:
   - Ensure that direct upgrade from 1.16.3 to 1.18.3 is supported. If not, perform intermediate upgrades.

3. **Plugins and Custom Code**:
   - Validate that any plugins or custom integrations are compatible with 1.18.3.

4. **Vault Agent and Clients**:
   - Ensure any Vault clients, such as Vault Agent, are compatible with the new version.

---

#### **E. Test in a Staging Environment**
1. **Set Up Sandbox Testing**:
   - Create a sandbox environment that mirrors production as closely as possible.
   - Test the upgrade process in the sandbox.

2. **Perform Upgrade Simulation**:
   - Upgrade a single node in the sandbox environment and validate functionality.
   - Test key use cases, such as reading/writing secrets, authentication, and unseal operations.

3. **Verify Rollback Plan**:
   - Test the rollback plan to confirm you can restore the previous version if needed.

### **2. Checklist Before Upgrade**
Here’s a summary checklist to validate before initiating the upgrade:

| **Item**                                 | **Validated? (✔/✘)** |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| All nodes are healthy (via `sys/health`).|                       |
| Replication is healthy (low/no lag).     |                       |
| Raft quorum is stable.                   |                       |
| Data and configuration backups completed.|                       |
| Review release notes for breaking changes.|                      |
| Secrets engines are operational.         |                       |
| Policies and auth methods validated.     |                       |
| Unseal mechanism is tested.              |                       |
| Upgrade tested in a sandbox.             |                       |
| Rollback plan is in place.               |                       |

### **3. Communication and Coordination**
1. **Communicate Downtime**:
   - Notify stakeholders of potential downtime during the upgrade.
   - Schedule the upgrade during a maintenance window.

2. **Team Coordination**:
   - Ensure all team members are aware of the upgrade plan.
   - Assign roles for monitoring, execution, and rollback.

---

### **4. Prepare for Execution**
- Validate that your root token is available and securely stored in case of emergency.
- Ensure you have access to the servers hosting the Vault nodes.
- Disable any automated systems that may interfere with the upgrade process.

### **Issue Overview: New Nodes Joining as Non-Voters and Leaving the Quorum**  
This problem arises from a **misconfigured Vault autopilot parameter**—`dead-server-last-contact-threshold`. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the issue, the relevant concepts, and how adjusting this parameter resolved it.

### **Autopilot and Raft Cluster Quorum in Vault**  
Vault uses **Raft consensus protocol** to manage high-availability clusters. Raft ensures that all cluster members (nodes) are in sync, with one elected **leader** and other **voting members** forming a quorum. Each node must sync with the leader to maintain consistency and be recognized as a **voter** in the cluster.

When new nodes join, they must:
1. **Download the Raft log data** (can be large).
2. Sync with the current state of the cluster before becoming active voting members.

If the data sync process takes too long (due to large data or network latency), the autopilot's **`dead-server-last-contact-threshold`** can mistakenly mark the new node as **unresponsive**, causing it to leave the quorum prematurely.

---

### **Understanding the Root Cause: `dead-server-last-contact-threshold`**  
The **`dead-server-last-contact-threshold`** parameter defines the **maximum allowed time a follower node can be out of contact with the leader** before being marked as **dead** and removed from the cluster.

- **Default value:** 24 hours (`24h`)  
- **Misconfigured value:** 1 minute (`1m`)  

In your scenario, the new node needed more than **1 minute** to replicate **7GB of Raft data** and sync with the leader. However, since the contact threshold was set to **1 minute**, the new node was marked as unresponsive before completing the sync. As a result:
- The node joined as a **non-voter** (since it couldn’t sync on time).
- It **left the quorum immediately**, disrupting the cluster’s stability.

---

### **Solution: Increasing `dead-server-last-contact-threshold` to 24h**  
By restoring the **default value of 24h**, the new node had enough time to replicate the required data from the leader and join the quorum as a voting member without being prematurely marked as dead.

- **Why 24h works:**  
  The larger threshold ensures that even under high load or large data replication scenarios, nodes have enough time to complete the sync process. 

---

### **Impact of the Fix**  
- **Stability:** With the correct threshold, new nodes can now join and stay in the cluster, contributing to the quorum.
- **Resilience:** The cluster maintains a healthy quorum of 5 nodes, avoiding split-brain scenarios.
- **Data Integrity:** The 24h threshold allows for consistent data replication, ensuring no data is lost or outdated during the node-joining process.

---

### **Best Practices for Managing Autopilot and Raft in Vault**
1. **Monitor Data Size and Latency:** Use telemetry metrics to track Raft log sizes and node health.
2. **Set Reasonable Thresholds:** Align parameters like `dead-server-last-contact-threshold` with your data size and replication speed.
3. **Test New Node Joins:** Before adding new nodes in production, simulate data replication in a test environment.

---

### **Key Metrics to Monitor Related to Node Health:**
- **`vault.autopilot.healthy`**: Reports if the autopilot mechanism is functioning correctly.
- **`vault.raft.replication_time`**: Measures the time taken to replicate logs to new nodes.
- **`vault.autopilot.last_contact_error`**: Indicates when nodes exceed the contact threshold.

This configuration ensures that large datasets or slower replication processes don’t inadvertently cause nodes to leave the cluster.


To **check and modify the Vault Autopilot configuration**, follow these steps. 

### **1. Check the Current Autopilot Configuration**  
You can view the autopilot configuration using Vault’s CLI or API.

#### **Using the Vault CLI:**
```bash
vault operator raft autopilot get-config
```
This command retrieves the current configuration for the autopilot settings. You will see output similar to:

```json
Autopilot Configuration:
  Cleanup Dead Servers: true
  Last Contact Threshold: 1m
  Max Servers: 5
  Min Quorum: 3
  Server Stale Threshold: 5m
```

- **`Cleanup Dead Servers`**: Automatically remove dead nodes.
- **`Last Contact Threshold`**: Defines the allowed contact delay with the leader.
- **`Server Stale Threshold`**: Marks servers as stale if not in sync for the specified period.

---

### **2. Modify the Autopilot Configuration**  
To adjust parameters like **`dead-server-last-contact-threshold`**, use the following commands.

#### **Using the Vault CLI:**
```bash
vault operator raft autopilot set-config \
  -cleanup-dead-servers=true \
  -last-contact-threshold=24h \
  -server-stale-threshold=10m
```

#### **Explanation:**
- **`-last-contact-threshold=24h`**: Increases the time allowed for nodes to sync with the leader, preventing premature removal.
- **`-cleanup-dead-servers=true`**: Ensures that non-functional nodes are automatically cleaned up.

---

### **3. Verifying the Changes**
After modifying the configuration, confirm the changes:

```bash
vault operator raft autopilot get-config
```

This should reflect the updated values.

---

### **4. Modifying Configuration via API (Optional)**
If you prefer to use the Vault API:

#### **API Request to Update Config:**
```bash
curl --header "X-Vault-Token: <your-token>" \
     --request PUT \
     --data '{"last_contact_threshold": "24h", "cleanup_dead_servers": true}' \
     http://<vault-address>:8200/v1/sys/storage/raft/autopilot/config
```

This ensures the config changes take effect without needing a Vault restart.

---

### **Best Practices:**
1. **Backup** the Vault state before making changes to the cluster.
2. **Monitor metrics** after the configuration change to ensure new nodes join correctly.
3. **Test the setup** in a staging environment before applying critical changes to production.

These steps help ensure the cluster remains stable with properly tuned autopilot settings.

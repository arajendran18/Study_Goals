Vault Cluster: 
A Vault cluster is a set of Vault processes that together run a Vault service. These Vault processes could be running on physical or virtual servers or in containers.
Availability Zones: 
An availability zone is a single network failure domain that hosts part or all of a Vault cluster. Examples of availability zones include:
	• An isolated datacenter
	• An isolated cage in a datacenter if it is isolated from other cages by all other means (power, network, etc)
	• An "Availability Zone" in AWS or Azure; A "Zone" in GCP
	
Region:
A region is a collection of one or more availability zones on a low-latency network. Regions are typically separated by significant distances. A region could host one or more Vault clusters, but a single Vault cluster would not be spread across multiple regions due to network latency issues.

Autoscaling:
Autoscaling is the process of automatically scaling computational resources based on service activity. Autoscaling may be either horizontal, meaning to add more machines into the pool of resources, or vertical, meaning to increase the capacity of existing machines.

1. Using Vault CLI
Overview: The Vault CLI is a straightforward tool to copy secrets within the same mount.

Steps:
Read the Secret Data: Use the vault kv get command to fetch the secret data.

bash
Copy code
vault kv get -format=json app-rmsservice-kv/old-folder/secret-key > secret.json
Write the Secret to the New Folder: Use the vault kv put command to write the data to the new folder.

bash
Copy code
vault kv put app-rmsservice-kv/new-folder/secret-key @secret.json
Repeat for All Keys (if needed): Automate with a script to loop through all secrets in the old folder and copy them to the new folder.

2. Using Vault API
Overview: The Vault API provides flexibility for applications or custom scripts.

Steps:
List Secrets in the Old Folder: Use the API to list all keys in the folder:

http
Copy code
GET https://<vault-url>/v1/app-rmsservice-kv/metadata/old-folder
Read and Write Each Secret: For each secret:

Read Secret Data:
http
Copy code
GET https://<vault-url>/v1/app-rmsservice-kv/data/old-folder/<key>
Write to New Folder:
http
Copy code
POST https://<vault-url>/v1/app-rmsservice-kv/data/new-folder/<key>
{
  "data": {
    <key-value pairs>
  }
}
Automate with a Script: Use a scripting language like Python to call these endpoints iteratively for all secrets.

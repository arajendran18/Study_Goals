What is git?
	• Git is a version control system. 
    • It is a Source control Management (SCM)
	• Git helps you keep track of code changes
	• Git is used to collaborate on code - Multiple people can work simultaneously.

Git Alternatives:
    1. SVN
    2. Mercurial

What is github?
Github is Web based git repository hosting service.

Github Alternatives:
	1. BitBucket
	2. GitBucket

Version Control System has following categories:
    1. CVCS - Central Version controlling System
    2. DVCS - Distributed Version controlling system

Difference between CVCS and DVCS:
    SVN works based on CVCS - Has only one repository - Internet dependent
    Git works based on DVCS - 2 repositories local and remote - Internet is only needed during push/pull command

Pre-requisites:
	1. Create an account for you:
	2. Download the Visual studio code:
	3. Install the latest version of git on your machine - Windows

Open your command prompt and type git - Ensure the git is successfully installed or not

Set username and email ID on our local machine
Git config --global user.name "<<<username>>>"
Git config --global user.email "<<example@gmail.com>>"

Open the visual studio code

Create a new folder on your machine

Open the folder in the visual studio code ( File-->Open folder..)

We already created a repo and file in github. Now we want to bring the file/folder from remote to local
Command: git clone <<link>>  -> link is something called origin
Command: cd githubemc1 --->Navigate into the particular folder in your local machine
Usually .git file will be invisible (Show the hidden files) - It acts a bridge between the remote repository and locally created folder.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Commonly used commands:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. Git clone --
        a. Create/Modify/Delete - Anything we perform after cloning.
    2. Git add -- Add the respective changes and moved on to the staging area (waiting area)
    3. Git commit --Move the respective file to git copy folder/local folder
    4. Git push -- Push the respective file into the global git repository.
    
Using the command move the newly created text2.txt from working copy to git copy folder
Command: git add test2.txt

'U' changed to added 'A' Added
Command: git status -->To know the status of the command

Now moving the test2.txt file from staging area to local git folder
Command: git commit -m "test2.txt file added"

To move the test2.txt file from local git folder to remote repository
Command: git push origin main



Insert --> Add--> Commit -->Push

Command: git init          --> Used to make the folder as git folder, initialize the empty git repository
Command: git status -s     --> To know the status of git -s -Short manner
Command: git add .         --> This . Represents all the changed files will move to staged area
Command: git commit -m     --> To Commit with the message
Command: git log           --> To view the logs information about the commit
Command: git log --oneline --> To view teh logs information in oneline
Command: git show <comt_id>-->To view the changes with respective to the commit ID
Command: git remote add <name> <url>--> To push to destination

How does branches work?

Command: git branch -a --> To list the branches
Command: git branch <<branch_name>> --create branch
Command: git checkout <<branch_name>> --> Switched to new branch
Command: git diff <<>branch_name>>> (when you are in main branch)

Merging the gitbranch1 with main branch
Command: git merge gitbranch1
Then we have to push
Command: git push origin main

Pull request: 
Feature provided by github. Cantt perform in terminal. Only performed in UI.
Manager will review the changes and merge the newbranch to main.

Command: git merge <<new_branch_name>>
Some issues may occur during Merge process.

Conflict:
Main branch contains : city = none
Branch1 branch contains : city = bangalore
Branch2 branch contains: city = chennai
If we try to merge branch1 and branch2 with main --> what city will get merged????

Resolve Conflicts:

Code Synchronization:
 Two different developers uploaded in common place.

What is conventional Commits?

What is Feature branch?

What is virtuality of files?
    We do have a file, but we can have in multiple virtual copies in multiple branches.

What is smooth merge?


Stages:

    1. Requirement Analysis
    2. Planning
    3. System Design (High level Diagram and Low Level Diagram) - people learnt UML - Unified Modelling language
    4. Implementation (Developers involved)
    5. Testing
    6. Deployment
    7. Maintenance


Advantages of devops team:
    • Devops team comes at 6th and 7th stage
    • Faster Delivery
    • More revenue
    • Cost reduction
    • Effort reduction

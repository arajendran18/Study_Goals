# Vault Configuration or Maintenance Issues - Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)

## 1. Path Temporarily Unavailable Due to Maintenance

### **Issue Description**
When a specific path in Vault is temporarily unavailable due to scheduled or unscheduled maintenance, users may experience errors such as "path not found" or "path unavailable."

### **Steps to Resolve**
1. **Identify Maintenance Activity**
   - Check the maintenance schedule.
   - Confirm with the team performing maintenance if the downtime was planned or unplanned.

2. **Notify Users**
   - Inform users about the maintenance and expected downtime.
   - Provide alternative paths or fallback options if available.

3. **Verify Path Accessibility**
   - After the maintenance, verify that the path is accessible:
     ```bash
     vault read <path>
     ```
   - If the path is still unavailable, check Vault logs for errors:
     ```bash
     journalctl -u vault | grep <path>
     ```

4. **Escalate if Necessary**
   - If the issue persists, escalate to the Vault administrator or support team with logs and error details.

### **Preventive Measures**
- Ensure all maintenance activities are communicated in advance.
- Test maintenance in a staging environment before applying changes to production.

## 2. Token Invalidated After Vault Was Sealed/Unsealed

### **Issue Description**
Tokens may become invalid after Vault undergoes a seal/unseal process, especially if Vault is using short-lived tokens.

### **Steps to Resolve**
1. **Diagnose the Issue**
   - Verify if the token is expired or invalid using the following command:
     ```bash
     vault token lookup <token>
     ```
   - Check Vault logs for token-related errors.

2. **Re-authenticate**
   - Request a new token from your authentication method (e.g., AppRole, LDAP, etc.):
     ```bash
     vault login -method=approle role_id=<role_id> secret_id=<secret_id>
     ```

3. **Update Applications**
   - Replace the old token with the new token in all client applications or scripts.

4. **Monitor Vault's Seal/Unseal Events**
   - Check why the seal/unseal process occurred:
     ```bash
     journalctl -u vault | grep seal
     ```
   - Address the root cause of frequent seal/unseal events.

### **Preventive Measures**
- Use token renewal mechanisms in applications.
- Avoid using long-lived tokens unless absolutely necessary.

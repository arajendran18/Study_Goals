Here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown of the GitLab security scanning and alert workflow for AWS Vault infrastructure, explaining each step thoroughly.

üîπ Step-by-Step Process in GitLab Security Scanning
1Ô∏è‚É£ Developer Pushes Code to AWS Vault Repository
A developer (e.g., Alice) commits and pushes code to the AWS Vault GitLab repository.
The push could include Terraform scripts, IAM role policies, Vault configurations, or application code.
This triggers the CI/CD pipeline, initiating security scans.
2Ô∏è‚É£ CI/CD Pipeline Triggers Security Scans
When the code is pushed, GitLab‚Äôs CI/CD pipeline (defined in .gitlab-ci.yml) runs various security scans:

SAST (Static Application Security Testing) ‚Üí Checks for insecure coding practices.
DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) ‚Üí Simulates attacks against running apps.
Secret Detection ‚Üí Scans for leaked AWS access keys, Vault tokens, or passwords.
Dependency Scanning ‚Üí Identifies vulnerabilities in third-party packages.
Container Scanning ‚Üí Analyzes Docker images for security issues.
If vulnerabilities are found, they are logged in the GitLab Security Dashboard.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Scheduled GitLab UI Security Policies Run Daily Scans
Separate from CI/CD pipeline scans, GitLab allows configuring scheduled scans via the Security & Compliance ‚Üí Policies section.
These scans run at regular intervals (e.g., every 24 hours) and detect vulnerabilities even if no new code is pushed.
Ensures continuous security monitoring across all AWS Vault-related projects.
4Ô∏è‚É£ If Vulnerabilities are Detected
Once a security scan completes, vulnerabilities are classified into five levels: üî¥ Critical ‚Äì Must be fixed immediately (e.g., leaked AWS root credentials).
üü† High ‚Äì Serious security flaws (e.g., unpatched Vault security issue).
üü° Medium ‚Äì Moderate risks (e.g., missing security headers in Vault UI).
üîµ Low ‚Äì Minor risks but should be addressed.
‚ö™ Info ‚Äì No immediate risk but informative (e.g., outdated dependencies).

4A. Merge Request Approval Policy Blocks Merge
If a Critical or High-severity vulnerability is found, GitLab blocks the Merge Request (MR).
This prevents insecure code from being merged into main/master branches.
4B. Vulnerability Management Policy Creates an Issue
If a vulnerability is detected, GitLab automatically creates an issue and assigns it to Bob (security engineer).
Bob reviews the report and works on a fix.
The issue remains open until it is remediated and verified.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Group-Level Security Policies Enforce Rules Across AWS Vault Repositories
If multiple AWS Vault repositories exist (e.g., for different teams), GitLab allows enforcing security rules at the group level.
These policies ensure:
All repositories run security scans before deployment.
Certain vulnerabilities automatically trigger alerts.
Developers cannot disable security scans manually.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Compliance Framework Policies Ensure Adherence to Security Standards
GitLab includes built-in Compliance Frameworks that enforce security policies for:
‚úÖ ISO 27001 (Security Management)
‚úÖ PCI-DSS (Payment Security)
‚úÖ SOC 2 (Cloud Security)
These policies ensure that AWS Vault configurations meet industry security requirements.
7Ô∏è‚É£ Security Team Reviews Vulnerability Reports
The GitLab Security Dashboard provides a detailed report of vulnerabilities.
Security engineers review:
Which AWS Vault repositories are affected?
What are the risk levels?
Is a quick fix available (e.g., dependency upgrade)?
8Ô∏è‚É£ If Issues Are Resolved, Merge Request is Approved, and Code is Deployed
If Bob (security engineer) fixes vulnerabilities, the issue is marked Resolved.
The Merge Request (MR) is re-evaluated and, if no critical vulnerabilities remain, it gets approved and merged.
The updated code is deployed to AWS Vault servers via the CI/CD pipeline.
9Ô∏è‚É£ If Vulnerabilities Remain, Further Remediation is Required
If critical vulnerabilities are still present, the Merge Request remains blocked.
Developers must implement fixes and re-run security scans.
If a critical security patch is needed, a hotfix branch may be created for immediate deployment.
üéØ Summary: End-to-End Process
Step	Description
1Ô∏è‚É£ Code Push	Developer commits code to AWS Vault repo
2Ô∏è‚É£ CI/CD Scans	SAST, DAST, Secret Detection, Dependency Scanning, etc.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Scheduled Scans	Regular security scans via GitLab UI policies
4Ô∏è‚É£ Vulnerability Found	Classified into Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info
5Ô∏è‚É£ Merge Blocked	If Critical/High issues exist
6Ô∏è‚É£ Group-Level Policies	Enforces security across all AWS Vault repos
7Ô∏è‚É£ Compliance Checks	Ensures security follows ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, SOC 2
8Ô∏è‚É£ Security Review	Engineers analyze vulnerabilities
9Ô∏è‚É£ Fix & Redeploy	Once issues are fixed, code is merged & deployed
üöÄ Final Takeaways
CI/CD pipeline policies control scanning during commit & merge.
GitLab UI policies handle scheduled scans at regular intervals.
Security policies enforce compliance across AWS Vault repositories.
Merge requests are blocked for high-risk vulnerabilities until fixed.
Automation policies create security alerts & assign them to engineers.

I can generate the content for your **PPT presentation** in a structured format that you can easily copy into PowerPoint. Hereâ€™s how it will be structured:  

### **Slide Structure:**
1. **Title Slide** â€“ "Q4 Accomplishments & Future Plan (FY25 - Q1)"
2. **Cluster Upgrade**
3. **Monitoring**
4. **Automation**
5. **SNOW Form Implementation**
6. **Support Ticket Analysis**
7. **Terraform Pipeline Integration with Teams**
8. **Support Tasks**
9. **Fulfilled SNOW Automated Failures**
10. **Future Plan (FY25 - Q1)**

I'll create the content in a structured format that you can paste directly into PowerPoint slides. Let me know if you'd like specific design suggestions (e.g., color scheme, icons, etc.).

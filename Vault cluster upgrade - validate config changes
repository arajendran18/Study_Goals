### **Validate Configuration Changes**

When upgrading Vault from one version to another, especially from 1.16 to 1.18, it's important to validate that your configuration is still valid and compatible with the new version. This process ensures that no critical features are broken due to deprecated or removed configuration options, and that your Vault instance operates efficiently with the new release.

Here’s a detailed explanation of how to validate configuration changes during an upgrade:

---

### **1. Compare the Existing Configuration with 1.18’s Requirements**

**Purpose**:  
Ensure that the existing configuration, such as `config.hcl` (or any other configuration files used for Vault), complies with the changes introduced in Vault 1.18. Some configuration parameters might have been deprecated, modified, or removed.

#### **Action Steps**:
- **Review Release Notes**:  
  - Vault 1.18 may have introduced new configuration parameters, removed existing ones, or changed the behavior of some. Review the Vault 1.18 release notes, especially the **breaking changes** and **deprecations** sections, to understand what has changed.
  
  **Example**:  
  - A certain configuration key that was used for logging level adjustments in Vault 1.16 may have been deprecated or modified in 1.18.

- **Identify Changes in Configuration**:  
  - Compare your current Vault configuration (e.g., `config.hcl`) with the default or recommended configuration for Vault 1.18.
  - Ensure that deprecated configuration options are either updated or removed.

**Scenario**:  
Your current Vault configuration includes the following for the storage backend:

```hcl
storage "consul" {
  address = "127.0.0.1:8500"
  scheme  = "https"
  verify  = true
}
```

In Vault 1.18, there may be a change or deprecation in the configuration of the `consul` storage backend. For example, the `verify` option could be deprecated and replaced with a different parameter. By reviewing the release notes, you find that Vault now requires `verify_ssl` instead of `verify`.

You update your configuration accordingly:
```hcl
storage "consul" {
  address     = "127.0.0.1:8500"
  scheme      = "https"
  verify_ssl  = true
}
```

---

### **2. Check Deprecated or Removed Configuration Options**

**Purpose**:  
Vault frequently evolves, and older configuration options may be deprecated or removed entirely. When upgrading, it’s important to check whether any of the configuration settings in use are no longer supported.

#### **Action Steps**:
- **Deprecation Warnings**:  
  - Check the Vault 1.18 release notes for any deprecated configuration options. Vault may still allow deprecated configurations but issue warnings, so you should check the Vault logs or configuration warnings to identify deprecated settings.

- **Remove Deprecated Configurations**:  
  - If you find deprecated options, replace them with their new counterparts as recommended by the Vault 1.18 documentation.

- **Removed Options**:  
  - If Vault has removed configuration options in 1.18 (e.g., due to security issues or architectural changes), you must adjust your configuration accordingly and remove any obsolete parameters.

**Scenario**:  
Vault 1.18 may remove support for a deprecated storage backend or an older authentication method. For example, if Vault previously supported the deprecated `vault.legacy` backend in 1.16, but this is completely removed in 1.18, your configuration would need to be adjusted to use an updated backend (e.g., `raft` or `consul`).

### **3. Update Policies if Necessary**

**Purpose**:  
Policies control access to Vault's various features and secret engines. With a new Vault version, new policies or changes to existing policies may be required to take advantage of new features or avoid potential security issues.

#### **Action Steps**:
- **Review New Features and Security Enhancements**:  
  - Check whether Vault 1.18 introduces new policies or policy rules, particularly around things like **granular audit logging**, **AWS Workload Identity Federation**, or **additional capabilities** for secrets engines. Make sure your policies are compatible with these changes.

- **Update Existing Policies**:  
  - If your policies grant broad permissions or don’t cover newly introduced features (such as `sys/policies/acl/*`), they should be updated to align with best practices.
  
- **Test Policy Changes**:  
  - Test the new or updated policies to ensure that the right level of access control is in place for users and applications interacting with Vault.

**Scenario**:  
Vault 1.18 introduces more granular control over audit logging. The new policies can specify different levels of logging for individual secret engines, so you may need to update your policies as follows:

```hcl
path "sys/audit" {
  capabilities = ["create", "read", "update"]
}

path "aws/creds/*" {
  capabilities = ["create", "read"]
}
```

You adjust your policies to reflect the new logging capabilities for audit paths and secret engines in Vault 1.18.

### **4. Review Autopilot Settings for Raft Storage**

**Purpose**:  
Autopilot is a feature used in Vault’s Raft storage backend to help with automatic node recovery and leadership election. Changes to Raft or autopilot settings could impact high-availability (HA) setups, particularly if new Vault versions introduce improvements or breaking changes related to cluster management.

#### **Action Steps**:
- **Check Autopilot Configuration**:  
  - Review the `autopilot` settings in your Vault configuration. Autopilot settings control things like **disruption budgets** and **election timeouts**. Ensure that these settings are aligned with any new recommendations or defaults introduced in Vault 1.18.
  
- **Adjust for Changes in Vault 1.18**:  
  - If Vault 1.18 introduces changes to Raft or Autopilot behavior (e.g., new defaults for timeouts or improved leader election logic), adjust your settings accordingly.

**Scenario**:  
Vault 1.18 introduces a more efficient method for automatic leader elections, so the `autopilot` configuration is optimized by default. You would want to ensure your current configuration follows these new settings.

For example, Vault 1.18 might change default timeout settings for leader elections or node recovery, which could require you to update your configuration:

```hcl
autopilot {
  enabled = true
  cleanup_dead_servers = "true"
  server_stabilization_time = "5s"  # Adjust this to match new defaults
}
```

---

### **Summary**

When upgrading to Vault 1.18, validating configuration changes is an essential step to ensure a smooth transition. This includes:
- **Comparing the existing configuration** to Vault 1.18’s requirements and removing or updating deprecated settings.
- **Checking for deprecated or removed configuration options** and replacing them with supported alternatives.
- **Updating policies** to take advantage of new features and ensure security best practices are followed.
- **Reviewing Autopilot settings** for Raft storage to ensure that high-availability and fault tolerance are maintained.

By carefully validating your configuration, you reduce the risk of encountering issues during and after the upgrade.

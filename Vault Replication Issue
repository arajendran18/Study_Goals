### **Vault Replication Issue SOP**  
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the steps to diagnose and resolve replication issues in a Vault cluster.

---

### **1. Objective**
To ensure smooth synchronization between primary, performance, and disaster recovery (DR) clusters in Vault, minimizing downtime and restoring normal replication functionality quickly.

---

### **2. Prerequisites**
- Admin access to all Vault clusters (primary, performance, and DR).  
- Knowledge of the replication topology and roles (primary, performance, DR).  
- Access to Vault logs and metrics (Splunk or any other logging tool).  
- Vault CLI and API access enabled.  

---

### **3. Common Symptoms of Replication Issues**
- **Out-of-Sync Data:** Data is inconsistent between the primary and secondary clusters.  
- **Stale Replicas:** DR or performance clusters show outdated information.  
- **Replication Status Errors:** Status in Vault UI or CLI indicates errors.  
- **High Latency:** Delays in data synchronization.  
- **Cluster Connection Errors:** Performance or DR clusters unable to communicate with the primary.  

---

### **4. Troubleshooting Steps**

#### **Step 1: Verify Replication Status**
- Use the Vault CLI or UI to check the replication status.  
  ```bash
  vault read sys/replication/status
  ```
  **What to look for:**  
  - Status of the primary and secondary clusters (active, standby, etc.).  
  - Lag or error messages.

---

#### **Step 2: Check Vault Logs**
- Examine logs for any replication-related errors. Use a logging tool like Splunk or access logs directly:  
  ```bash
  cat /var/log/vault/vault.log | grep 'replication'
  ```
  **Common errors to watch for:**  
  - TLS handshake errors.  
  - Token revocation or expiration.  
  - Network connectivity issues.

---

#### **Step 3: Verify Token and Policies**
- Ensure the secondary cluster has a valid replication token from the primary.  
  - Generate a new token if required:  
    ```bash
    vault write -f sys/replication/primary/secondary-token id=<secondary-cluster-id>
    ```
  - Verify policies attached to the replication token. Ensure it has sufficient permissions (`replication-secondary` policy).

---

#### **Step 4: Network Connectivity Check**
- Test connectivity between the primary and secondary clusters.  
  ```bash
  ping <secondary-cluster-IP>
  telnet <secondary-cluster-IP> 8200
  ```
  **What to do if there are issues:**  
  - Check firewall rules.  
  - Verify DNS resolution.  

---

#### **Step 5: Validate Certificates**
- If TLS is enabled, ensure certificates are valid and match across clusters.  
  ```bash
  openssl s_client -connect <cluster-IP>:8200
  ```
  **Common issues:**  
  - Expired certificates.  
  - Mismatched CA.

---

#### **Step 6: Restart Replication Process**
- **Disable and re-enable replication:**  
  On the primary cluster:  
  ```bash
  vault write -f sys/replication/primary/disable
  vault write sys/replication/primary/enable
  ```
  On the secondary cluster:  
  ```bash
  vault write sys/replication/secondary/enable token=<replication-token>
  ```

---

#### **Step 7: Monitor Metrics**
- Check Vault replication metrics to identify ongoing issues:  
  - **Latency metrics:** High latency can indicate network issues.  
  - **Error rates:** Frequent errors in replication requests.  

---

#### **Step 8: Perform a Full Sync**
- Trigger a full synchronization to resolve data inconsistencies.  
  ```bash
  vault write -f sys/replication/secondary/sync
  ```

---

#### **Step 9: Escalation**
If issues persist, escalate to the Vault support team or the HashiCorp technical support team with the following details:  
- Replication status output.  
- Relevant logs and metrics.  
- Recent configuration changes.

---

### **5. Preventive Measures**
- Regularly monitor replication status using automated tools.  
- Schedule periodic token renewals for replication tokens.  
- Test connectivity and TLS certificates during routine maintenance.  
- Document and review all configuration changes affecting replication.

This SOP ensures systematic troubleshooting and resolution of Vault replication issues while maintaining operational continuity.

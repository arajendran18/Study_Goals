**Title: Removal of Unused TLS Certificate Configuration in Vault**

**Background:**  
During a routine audit of Vault configuration and automation scripts, we identified a section of the script related to `kms_root.crt` that appeared to be unused. Our objective was to determine whether this stanza could be safely removed without impacting Vault operations.

**Analysis Process:**  
1. **Vault Configuration Review:**  
   - Checked all Vault configuration files.
   - Did not find any reference to `kms_root.crt`.

2. **Service Utilization Check:**  
   - Verified whether Vault services referenced `kms_root.crt`.
   - Confirmed that it was not utilized by Vault processes.

3. **Script & Automation Review:**  
   - Conducted a search across all relevant automation scripts.
   - Found no references to `kms_root.crt` in any scripts or processes.

**Removed Stanza:**  
The following lines were removed from the script as they were determined to be unnecessary:

```
aws s3 cp "${self_signed_cert_path}/kms_root.crt" /opt/vault/tls/kms_root.crt
aws s3 cp "${self_signed_cert_path}/ssct" /tmp/ssct
chmod 0755 /tmp/ssct
/tmp/ssct -command=new-node \
    -region=${region} \
    -arn=${signing_key_arn} \
    -ca=/opt/vault/tls/kms_root.crt \
    -output_cert=/opt/vault/tls/node.crt \
    -output_key=/opt/vault/tls/node.key \
    -node_ip=$local_ipv4 \
    -node_dns_name=$instance_id
chown root:vault /opt/vault/tls/node.*
chmod 0640 /opt/vault/tls/node.key
chmod 0644 /opt/vault/tls/node.crt
```

**Conclusion:**  
Since `kms_root.crt` was neither referenced in Vault configuration nor used by any Vault services or automation scripts, it was deemed **safe to remove**. This change helps in reducing unnecessary file transfers and ensures the script remains clean and optimized.

**Action Taken:**  
- The unused stanza has been removed from the script.
- Post-removal verification confirmed no impact on Vault functionality.

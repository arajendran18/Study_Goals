### **Detailed SOP for Resolving Raft Consensus Latency High Alert in Vault**

The **Raft Consensus Latency High** alert signals delays in the Raft consensus mechanism that Vault uses to synchronize data across nodes. This issue can disrupt cluster stability, degrade performance, and risk data integrity.

---

### **Step-by-Step SOP**

#### **Step 1: Acknowledge and Verify the Alert**

##### **Purpose**:
Ensure the alert is genuine and assess the severity and potential impact.

##### **Actions**:
1. **Acknowledge the Alert**:
   - Acknowledge the alert in your monitoring system (e.g., CloudWatch).
   - Notify stakeholders if the alert impacts critical services.

2. **Verify Metrics**:
   - Use CloudWatch to review `vault.raft.replication.latency` metrics.
   - Confirm latency values exceed the threshold (e.g., >100ms).

3. **Review Logs**:
   - Check logs for errors related to Raft consensus:
     ```bash
     tail -f /var/log/vault.log
     ```
   - Look for messages like:
     - `Raft heartbeat timeout`
     - `Failed to apply log entry`
   - Use log aggregation tools (e.g., CloudWatch Logs Insights) to filter for relevant entries:
     ```
     fields @timestamp, @message
     | filter @message like /Raft|heartbeat/
     ```

#### **Step 2: Assess Cluster Health**

##### **Purpose**:
Identify the state of the cluster and locate unhealthy nodes.

##### **Actions**:
1. **List Raft Peers**:
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     vault operator raft list-peers
     ```
   - Review the output for:
     - Leader status.
     - Follower health.
     - Nodes marked as `unhealthy` or `stale`.

   **Example Output**:
   ```
   Node            Address               State      Voter
   vault-1         10.0.0.1:8201         Leader     true
   vault-2         10.0.0.2:8201         Follower   true
   vault-3         10.0.0.3:8201         Unhealthy  true
   ```

2. **Check Cluster Leadership**:
   - Identify the leader node.
   - If the leader is slow or unresponsive, initiate a re-election:
     ```bash
     vault operator step-down
     ```

3. **Verify Node Connectivity**:
   - Check network latency between nodes using `ping` or `traceroute`:
     ```bash
     ping 10.0.0.2
     ```
   - Verify latency is within acceptable limits (e.g., <50ms for same-region nodes).

4. **Check Resource Usage**:
   - Review resource metrics in CloudWatch for each node:
     - CPUUtilization
     - MemoryUtilization
     - DiskReadOps / DiskWriteOps

#### **Step 3: Investigate and Mitigate Immediate Causes**

##### **a. Network Latency**
- **Cause**: Poor network performance or misconfigured routing between nodes.
- **Resolution**:
  - Check VPC security groups and NACLs to ensure proper node communication.
  - Use AWS Direct Connect or VPC Peering for inter-region connectivity.
  - For AWS regions, ensure inter-region latency is minimal (<100ms).

##### **b. Resource Constraints**
- **Cause**: Nodes lack sufficient CPU, memory, or IOPS to handle the load.
- **Resolution**:
  - Scale up instance types (e.g., move from t3.medium to m5.large).
  - Use CloudWatch to monitor and verify resource improvements.

##### **c. Disk I/O Latency**
- **Cause**: Raft operations require high-performance disk I/O for log replication.
- **Resolution**:
  - Use high-performance storage like AWS gp3 or io2 volumes.
  - Ensure disk IOPS match Vaultâ€™s workload.

---

#### **Step 4: Optimize Raft Configuration**

##### **Purpose**:
Adjust Raft settings to minimize latency.

##### **Actions**:
1. **Tune Heartbeat Timeout**:
   - Reduce heartbeat timeout to detect and recover from slow nodes faster:
     ```bash
     vault operator raft configuration-set -heartbeat-timeout=100ms
     ```

2. **Log Compaction**:
   - Remove stale Raft logs to reduce replication overhead:
     ```bash
     vault operator raft snapshot save /path/to/snapshot
     ```

---

#### **Step 5: Long-Term Mitigation**

##### **a. Optimize Cluster Topology**
- Colocate cluster nodes in the same region to minimize network latency.
- Maintain an odd number of nodes (3 or 5) for efficient quorum-based consensus.

##### **b. Use Performance Replication**
- Offload read-heavy workloads to a performance replication cluster.

##### **c. Set Up Proactive Monitoring**
- Configure CloudWatch alarms for:
  - `vault.raft.replication.latency`
  - Node CPU and memory utilization.
  - Disk I/O performance.

---

#### **Step 6: Validate Resolution**

##### **Purpose**:
Ensure the alert no longer triggers and operations are stable.

##### **Actions**:
1. **Monitor Metrics**:
   - Check Raft replication latency in CloudWatch.
   - Ensure values are within acceptable thresholds (e.g., <10ms for intra-region).

2. **Verify Cluster Health**:
   - List Raft peers and confirm all nodes are `healthy`:
     ```bash
     vault operator raft list-peers
     ```

3. **Test Client Operations**:
   - Perform read and write operations on the Vault cluster.
   - Verify no errors or delays in responses.

### **Example Scenario**
**Alert**: Raft Consensus Latency High  
**Root Cause**: Inter-region network latency due to a misconfigured security group blocking traffic between nodes.  

**Steps Taken**:
1. Verified alert in CloudWatch and identified high replication latency.
2. Used `vault operator raft list-peers` to find that one node was `unhealthy`.
3. Ran `ping` and identified high network latency between nodes in different regions.
4. Updated security group rules to allow communication between nodes.
5. Monitored metrics and confirmed latency returned to normal levels (<10ms).

---

### **Key Considerations**
1. Always address Raft latency issues promptly to prevent cluster instability.
2. Ensure proactive monitoring to detect issues before they escalate.
3. Document root causes and solutions to build an effective incident response plan.

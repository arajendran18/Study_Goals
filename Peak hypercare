## **Epic:** Peak Hypercare for Vault Operations  

### 1. **Story 1: Monitor Vault Node Health and Availability**  
   **Description:**  
   Set up continuous monitoring to track the health and availability of Vault nodes during peak hypercare. Alerts should be triggered for any downtime or node failures.  

   **Tasks:**  
   - Configure monitoring tools (e.g., Splunk, Prometheus) to track Vault node metrics.  
   - Create alerts for leadership loss, node unavailability, and latency issues.  
   - Test alert notifications to ensure reliability.  

---

### 2. **Story 2: Ensure High Availability and Cluster Synchronization**  
   **Description:**  
   Validate the synchronization between Vault clusters (e.g., primary, DR, and performance clusters) to prevent disruptions.  

   **Tasks:**  
   - Verify that replication between primary and DR clusters is enabled and working.  
   - Monitor for any **raft leadership changes** and ensure smooth failovers.  
   - Perform manual checks to ensure secrets and policies are consistent across clusters.  

---

### 3. **Story 3: Validate Performance of Secret Engines**  
   **Description:**  
   Ensure all secret engines (AWS, Azure, etc.) are working correctly during hypercare to avoid disruptions in service.  

   **Tasks:**  
   - Validate access to critical secret engines in both production (PRD) and non-production (NPD) environments.  
   - Test the generation of dynamic credentials from AWS and Azure engines.  
   - Set up automated scripts to periodically validate the availability of secret engines.  

---

### 4. **Story 4: Implement Incident Management Process**  
   **Description:**  
   Define the incident management process during peak hypercare, ensuring rapid issue detection and resolution.  

   **Tasks:**  
   - Define escalation paths and assign responsibilities for responding to Vault incidents.  
   - Set up PagerDuty or ServiceNow to log alerts as incidents and notify the on-call team.  
   - Document SLAs for responding to and resolving incidents during hypercare.  

---

### 5. **Story 5: Backup and Restore Validation**  
   **Description:**  
   Ensure Vault backups are taken regularly, and test restoration processes to confirm they work during emergencies.  

   **Tasks:**  
   - Schedule periodic backups of Vault data and validate backups for integrity.  
   - Perform a mock restore from backup to ensure the process is well-documented and functional.  
   - Ensure access to backups in both the primary and DR environments.  

---

### 6. **Story 6: Monitor Vault Latency and API Performance**  
   **Description:**  
   Track latency in API calls and monitor user access to the Vault UI to ensure peak performance during hypercare.  

   **Tasks:**  
   - Use Splunk or other monitoring tools to track Vault API latency.  
   - Set thresholds for acceptable latency and configure alerts for anomalies.  
   - Monitor Vault UI login success/failure trends to detect potential authentication issues.  

---

### 7. **Story 7: Optimize Access Control and Policy Management**  
   **Description:**  
   Validate access control policies and ensure they are appropriately configured to prevent overprivileged access.  

   **Tasks:**  
   - Scan for overprivileged policies using the linter integrated with the GitLab pipeline.  
   - Audit all active Vault policies and roles to ensure they align with security guidelines.  
   - Apply policy corrections to reduce access to the least privilege required.  

---

### 8. **Story 8: Communication and Documentation**  
   **Description:**  
   Establish communication channels and maintain detailed documentation for operations during hypercare.  

   **Tasks:**  
   - Set up communication channels (e.g., Slack, Teams) for real-time updates.  
   - Document all hypercare processes, incidents, and resolutions for future reference.  
   - Provide daily status reports to stakeholders on Vault operations during hypercare.  

---

### 9. **Story 9: Validate Token and Authentication Mechanisms**  
   **Description:**  
   Ensure that all Vault authentication methods (OIDC, AWS IAM, AppRole) are working without issues.  

   **Tasks:**  
   - Validate OIDC integration with Azure AD and test user access to the Vault UI.  
   - Check that AWS IAM roles can successfully authenticate and generate credentials.  
   - Ensure token renewals and expirations are functioning as expected.  

---

### 10. **Story 10: Post-Hypercare Handover and Reporting**  
   **Description:**  
   After the hypercare period, hand over responsibilities and document key learnings for future operations.  

   **Tasks:**  
   - Prepare a post-hypercare summary report, highlighting any issues and resolutions.  
   - Conduct a retrospective to identify areas for improvement.  
   - Handover monitoring and incident management to regular operations teams.
